#### Train

Reading Station is a short walk. To avoid the back roads while walking to the venue head straight to broad street (the main pedestrianized high-street) and then follow that to the venue past the front entrance of the Broad Street Mall

#### Driving

Nearest car park is the "Broad Street Mall" car park that's on top of the same building. (You'll have to walk round the outside to get in, it's not in the mall).

It's also a short walk from the Oracle Riverside car park, and Q-Park Chatham Place car park.

## Facilities

Coffee shop downstairs open till 8pm

Bar and food available from venue.

## Agenda

Grab a drink, join us at our table, introduce yourself and chat about all things Rust

We'll do a quick round of 5 minute show and tell slots at around 7pm around a laptop so anyone can share what they've been working on. Bring your laptop if you wish.

## Stay in touch
