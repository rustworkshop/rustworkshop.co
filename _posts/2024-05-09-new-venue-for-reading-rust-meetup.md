If you weren't aware, The Rust Workshop runs a meetup in the tech hub of Reading, UK, providing a local focal point for all with an interest in Rust without having to travel into London.

The schedule is **the second Tuesday of every month**, and you can subscribe on meetup.com here: [Reading Rust Workshop Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/reading-rust-workshop/) - next event is this coming Tuesday.

The news for this month is that following the closing down of Browns on the Oracle riverside we had to find a new venue. After zipping round a series of possible venues for us to use yesterday evening and selecting a winner, we'll be holding our meetups from now on at [Reading Biscuit Factory](https://www.readingbiscuitfactory.co.uk/about-us), which provides a great atmosphere for a gathering of like-minded people, a bar, coffee shop and food services all in the same building (plus a three screen cinema, and a couple of rentable rooms we can use if we want to put on talks).
